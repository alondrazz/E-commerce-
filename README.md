# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

## I had to make a E-commerce Back End starter code using Express.js API, and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. 

## You will need to copy my Github code and clone it to your machine and then download npm package. I will also provide a link to a walkthrough video of how my application works.

## Examples of how to use this application is by getting an idea or a good start to making your own application, by looking at my code.


## I had a lot of help from my Teacher assistant, as well as past assignments from my class and I also had helped from ASKBCS.
